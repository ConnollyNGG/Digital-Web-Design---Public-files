<p>We went to the Grand Canyon this summer while we were in Arizona. We thought you would like to see some of our awesome pictures. We took so many shots, but these were really the best.</p>

<p>You can see how beautiful the Grand Canyon can be with this picture. We were able to stand right on the edge of the viewing path and shoot this scene. This is the image that I use on my desktop. It is a constant reminder to me about how wonderful that vacation was.</p>
<p>We stayed in the Grand Canyon lodge that trip, which is very close to the visitor's center. The center is just great. They conduct many classes there and provide you with wonderful information about how the canyon was formed.</p>

<p>This is another great picture that we were able to take. As you can see, we captured the view of the canyon through a group of massive boulders. It was such a beautiful scene that we had to snap it.</p>
<p>If you look to the right-side of the picture, you see a flat rock. At one point in our visit, we actually saw people hiking there. I would love to do that, but I would be so frightened to do that. I know my husband would jump at the chance to do that kind of hiking, and so would the kids!</p>
