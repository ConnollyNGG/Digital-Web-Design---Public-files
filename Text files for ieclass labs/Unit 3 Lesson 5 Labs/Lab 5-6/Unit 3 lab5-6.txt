Business Communication

You want a part-time job. You want a date. You want to win the student government election. You want a loan from the bank to buy a new car. What does it take to get what you want in these situations? It takes communication savvy! Communication savvy involves influencing people to think and act according to your desires, practicing good human relations skills, and using the English language correctly.

Because you have been communicating since you were born, you may think that good communication is simply "doing what comes natural", but communication is a complicated process and is developed only through practice and concentrated effort. Your first reaction may be "If communication is that difficult, why bother?" First of all, you cannot avoid communicating. Of your total waking hours, 70 percent of that time is spent in some form of communication - writing, reading, speaking, and listening. Second, the leaders in your community will tell you that communication skills are important in achieving personal and professional goals. Third, you will have a competitive edge in getting a job, being promoted, and projecting a positive image to your boss and co-workers if you have good communication skills. Fourth, you will have a more productive and satisfying life because you will be more efficient in your work and will develop more meaningful relationships in your social life. Developing communications savvy pays dividends again and again!
